Cloud DB
+ Primary key issue

If Users want to use Cloud DB , They should declare at least one primary key in table, but Cloud DB doesn't provide any solution for this feature like auto increment.

Solution

Primary key should be generated in code part using Random generator by Developers.

---------------------------

+Model Properties of Cloud DB

Cloud DB doesn't support annotation binding like Room DB so model name should be declared correctly and they should be same with table column in CloudDB.

------------------------

Cloud Hosting 

Cloud Hosting can be used for static web page. And it has own folder structure . IF your web site doesn't meet this restriction, It won't be released on Cloud Hosting.
Web site structure should be same with following one.

+Site name
 +images
 +js
 +css
 +index.html

In addition, Web site can be uploaded as zip file into Cloud Hosting.
