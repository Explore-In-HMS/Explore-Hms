    <string name="info_text_av_pipeline_kit">AV Pipeline Kit is a system of open capabilities for easier media app development. It contains a lightweight framework and a range of high-performance plugins for audio and video processing. The framework parses plugin orchestration logic from each configuration file to create a pipeline with capabilities such as media playback, recording, or editing, while each plugin in a pipeline undertakes specific tasks, for example, demuxing, decoding, and filtering.\n\nAV Pipeline Kit presets pipelines for scenarios like video playback, video super-resolution, and sound event detection, and provides Java APIs for you to use these pipelines. You can also call a single preset plugin directly through C++ APIs. If you want to achieve more functions other than those provided by the preset plugins or pipelines, you can even customize some plugins or pipelines based on your own needs.</string>
