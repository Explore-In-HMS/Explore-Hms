Apps integrated with the Dynamic Ability SDK can dynamically download features or language packages from HUAWEI AppGallery as required, reducing the unnecessary consumption of network traffic and device storage space.\n\nIn addition, you can register listeners to listen to the loading status. Currently, the Dynamic Ability SDK supports mobile phones, smart screens, and speakers with screens.</string>
