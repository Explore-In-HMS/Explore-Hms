    <string name="desc_managing_open_test">AppGallery Connect provides the function of managing open testing user lists. You can manage your test users in AppGallery Connect and distribute the open testing version of your app to the corresponding test users.\n\n\u2022Creating a User List: Before distributing an open testing version, you need to create a list of users who participate in the open testing. The list can be imported by file or manual input. You can create up to 30 test user lists in total and 20 per day. There are two different modes to add open test users. With manual input, you need to set User information to manual input and click Add to add HUAWEI IDs for the test users one by one. If there are a large number of test users, you can import them by file. After you select File import, you can click Download template to download the User_Import_Template.csv template. Edit the file using a text editor. Enter HUAWEI ID information based on the template, and click Import to import the file. After the import is successful, all test user information is displayed on the test user list.\n\u2022Editing a User List: After a user list is created, you can change the list name, add new users, delete users from the user list, and edit user names.\n\u2022Deleting a User List: You can delete a user list if users on the list will not be involved in the test.\n</string>
    <string name="desc_distributing_app_to_test_users">Apps open testing versions can be released and modified afterwards. \n\n\u2022Releasing an App of the Open Testing Version: After your app is packaged, you can release the app of the open testing version in AppGallery Connect and select the list of test users to distribute your app. Please note that apps in App Bundle format cannot be free of manual review.\n\u2022Modifying Distribution Information: After the open testing version of your app is released, you can go to Distribute > Release app > Version information and click the app version in Released state to view details about the open testing. In this section, you  can change your test period,  add new users to or delete users from the test user list, export a test user list to download it in .csv format to a local path, check the users invitation acceptance status like unsent, invited, accepted, installed and unsubscribed and send an invitation to all users on the list again. \n</string>
    <string name="desc_participating_open_testing_plan">There are two ways to participate an open testing plan.\n\n\u2022Email: If an email address is added as a HUAWEI ID to the user list, the open testing invitation will be sent to the email address. If a test user does not want to participate in the open testing and receive the invitation email again, the user can click Unsubscribe from these emails in the email. After the email is unsubscribed, the test user will not receive the similar emails, and the mobile number bound to the email address will not receive invitation SMS messages. After unsubscribing from an invitation email, a user can click Subscribe to emails in the email to subscribe to invitation emails again. If the system displays a message indicating that the link is invalid, the user can contact via the email address in the invitation email to resend the invitation. If a test user has installed a released version of the app, HUAWEI AppGallery prompts the user to update the app. An exception is that if the installed app version is earlier than 10.4.0, HUAWEI AppGallery does not prompt the user to update the app. The user needs to uninstall the installed version and then download the test version of the app.\n\u2022SMS Message: If a mobile number is added as a HUAWEI ID to the user list, the open testing invitation will be sent to the mobile number. Please notice that carriers may block invitation messages. As a result, test users whose HUAWEI IDs are mobile numbers cannot receive invitation messages. Also, if a test user has installed a released version of the app, HUAWEI AppGallery prompts the user to update the app. An exception is that if the installed app version is earlier than 10.4.0, HUAWEI AppGallery does not prompt the user to update the app. The user needs to uninstall the installed version and then download the test version of the app.\n</string>
